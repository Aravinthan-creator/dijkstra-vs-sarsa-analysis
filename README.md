# dijkstra-vs-sarsa-analysis
 Objectives Implement:  Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal pathfinding in a static maze (weighted grid).  SARSA (on-policy temporal difference RL) using PyTorch to learn navigation via interaction.  Compare:  Optimality of paths found.  Computation/Training time.  Adaptability—SARSA’s ability to adjust to changes versus Dijkstra’s static solution.
